    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="update-date">Last Updated: July 25, 2024</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p>Welcome to our video player app! We take your privacy very seriously. This privacy policy explains how our app handles your data. We solemnly promise: <strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section highlight">
        <h2>Core Principle: Your Data Belongs to You</h2>
        <p>Our core design philosophy is to protect user privacy to the greatest extent possible. All data processing, whenever possible, is done locally on your device. We do not maintain servers to store user data, nor do we share your information with any third parties.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>We Do Not Collect Any Information</h2>
        <p>This app does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) or any other form of user data. Specifically, we do not collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your name, email address, phone number, or any contact information.</li>
            <li>Your geographic location information.</li>
            <li>Your device unique identifiers (such as UDID, IDFA).</li>
            <li>Any analytics data, advertising identifiers, or user behavior tracking information.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>On-Device Data Processing</h2>
        <p>Some advanced features of this app require data processing, but all such processing is done offline on your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Files and Playback History</strong>: Video files you open through this app, playback history, playback progress, and video metadata (such as filename, duration) are stored only in your device's local storage. This data is completely under your control and can be deleted at any time within the app. We cannot access this information.</li>
            <li><strong>Speech Recognition (Subtitle Generation)</strong>: To generate subtitles from video audio tracks, this app will request your "Speech Recognition" permission. We use Apple's speech recognition framework and enforce <strong>offline recognition</strong> on your device. Your audio data never leaves your device and is not sent to Apple or us.</li>
            <li><strong>Text Translation</strong>: When you translate generated subtitles, we use Apple's translation framework. This feature prioritizes <strong>offline translation</strong> on your device. For some language pairs requiring online support, data will be sent directly by your operating system to Apple's servers for processing, following Apple's privacy policy. This app does not intercept, store, or forward this information.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Permission Requests Explained</h2>
        <p>To provide core functionality, this app may request the following permissions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>File Access Permission</strong>: You need to authorize this app to access video files or folders you wish to play through the system file picker. We use Apple's security mechanism (Security-Scoped Bookmarks) to maintain access to files after your authorization, avoiding the need to reselect each time. We never access files you have not explicitly authorized.</li>
            <li><strong>Speech Recognition Permission</strong>: This permission is requested when you need to use the "Speech to Subtitle" feature. If you decline, it will only affect this specific feature; other app functions will continue to work normally.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>This app includes in-app purchases (subscription services) processed through the Apple App Store. All transaction processes are handled directly by Apple. We do not obtain any of your payment information (such as credit card numbers) or personal account information. We only store your subscription status locally on your device (for example, whether you are an active subscriber) to unlock premium features.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>No Third-Party Integration</h2>
        <p>This app does not integrate any third-party analytics tools, advertising networks, or social media SDKs. Your usage behavior is completely anonymous.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy. If we make significant changes, we will notify you through in-app notifications or by posting updates on our App Store page. We recommend you review this policy periodically for the latest information.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
